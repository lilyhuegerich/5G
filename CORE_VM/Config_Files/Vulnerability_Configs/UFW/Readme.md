# Routing Configurations


## UEs connecting to NFs.

If the UEs can connect to the NFs they have the potentialy to wreck all sorts of havoc ;). For more on this you can check the [Scan\_Network](../../../../UE_VM/Exploit_Scripts/Scan_Network) section for the UE\_VM.

To stop the UEs from being able to reach the NFs you can use [disallow\_NF\_access.sh](disallow_NF_access.sh):

```console
user@5g:~/5G/CORE_VM/Config_Files/Vulnerability_Configs/UFW$ ./disallow_NF_access.sh

```

And if you want to allow it:

```console
user@5g:~/5G/CORE_VM/Config_Files/Vulnerability_Configs/UFW$ ./allow_NF_access.sh

```

Please note if you are using subnets other than 10.45.0.0\16 and 10.47.0.0.\16 you will havce to update [disallow\_NF\_access.sh](disallow_NF_access.sh) and [allow\_NF\_access.sh](allow_NF_access.sh)
