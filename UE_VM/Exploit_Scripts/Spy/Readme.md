# Insider attack 

In this scenario you were able to start a proccess that logs everything that happens on a certain interface on the victim machine. To see [here](../../../CORE_VM/Config_Files/Vulnerability_Configs/Spy) on how to do this. 

Now you want to recieve the messages from your insider spy to do this run the following:

```console
user@uevm:~/5G/UE_VM/Exploit_Scripts/Spy$ ./spy.sh -p <port to listen on>
```
